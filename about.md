Claire Garwacki is a recognized Switzerland-based headhunter, specialized in
corporate finance.
Her focus is the upper management level for finance departments (country CFOs, 
regional finance directors, VPs Finance, accounting directors, controlling managers 
and country controllers).

Claire was previously the Finance Director of a French fashion brand in the
retail sector and a senior financial auditor for Ernst and Young Paris.
She joined the recruiting industry in 2011 when she realized - being a
client and a candidate - the importance of being listened to, and
understood by a peer. Claire started her recruiting career in 2011 with a
renowned international firm and joined a few years later a very well
established Swiss boutique. Thanks to a rapidly growing word of mouth,
her name has become a reference in Switzerland.
Claire speaks English, French, German and Spanish.
She is now the owner of FG Partner Gmbh, "your partner for finance recruiments".
