## Giving you access to my network

Over the last 11 years, I have developed a strong network of finance
professionals across Europe. They are my previous colleagues, managers,
providers or clients. Most of them are in a trustful relationship with their
employer, and therefore not actively looking for new job opportunities.

They are however always happy to catch-up with me and casually hear of external
career options.

I got to know most of my recent "candidates" via word of mouth and referrals.

## Strict selection

The screening I undertake consists of a 2 hour interview, covering all aspects
of the CV. My financial background enables me to test the candidate's technical
as well as business skills. I also give a lot of importance to the motivation :
is this candidate going to be happy and stay in your team ?

References are systematically taken, either early or later during the process.
